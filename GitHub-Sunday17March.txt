######## GitHub Sunday 17 March

Created new repository in Git Hub called: git@github.com:r0r-systems1/reserv-2.git

Changed Rails_projects/REservations
Did a git pull 
Then did: git commit -a -m"sunday arvo"
and then: git push git@github.com:r0r-systems1/reserv-2.git
And complete file system is in the github


Cannot push to the original git@github.com:r0r-systems1/Reservations.git because:
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:r0r-systems1/Reservations.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
and git pull does nothing...........
